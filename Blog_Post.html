        The Westweg trail is located in Southern Germany. The starting point
        is on the Norhern border of the German Black Forest in the city of
        Pforzheim, called "The Golden City". Pforzheim once got this name
        because in Pforzheim Jewellery has been the main industry for decades.
        After having gone south for several miles, one will enter the Black Forest. 
        You will cross the whole low mountain range and climb up to heights of
        1000 - 1500 meters. You will climb on top of the mountains 'Belchen',
        'Blauen' and of course the 'Feldberg'. The 'Feldberg' is the highest mountain with
        a height of 1.496 meters. In the end, after 14 stages, you will arrive 
        in Swizerland by entering the city of 'Basel'.

        Infrastructure
      </h2>
      <div class="box">
        There are several resting places along the way. From time to time,
        you will see banks made of wood, made for hikers, where you can lay 
        down and enjoy the scenery while having a rest.
        On most stages there will be at least one possibility to have lunch
        in a restaurant, however be prepared that there are stages where this
        opportunity is missing. So you should take care for your lunch package
        in advance!
